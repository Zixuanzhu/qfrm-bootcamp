	<li>Getting started with GitHub
		<ol type="a">
			<li>From GitHub Desktop, click on the '+' in the upper left to create a new repository, create a GitHub repository named <code>qfrm-python</code>. For Windows, I suggest using the Local Path 'C:\Users\yourUserName\Documents\GitHub\'.</li>
			<li>Launch Atom (on Windows, you can launch it from GitHub Desktop via the icon in the upper right). Create a README.md file using Atom in your <code>qfrm-python</code> directory. Add this text to it: “These are programs I’ve written while learning Python. The implementation is in Jupyter notebooks." </li>
			<li>In GitHub Desktop, refresh the Changes tab in your <code>qfrm-python</code> project, and Publish. Then commit your changes (set Summary to something like "initial commit"), and sync.</a>
			</li>
			<li>Log in to <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> in your browser, and navigate to your <code>qfrm-python</code> repo. You should see your files listed, and your README.md file has been rendered as HTML.</a>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Getting started with Jupyter and Python
		<ol type="a">
			<li>Jupyter runs Python in your browser, using a Jupyter Notebook. The Notebook requires a local server to be running, which you will start using a shell script. Notebooks support Markdown, and python code with full access to everything you got from Anaconda. We will start by downloading the stubbed notebook <a href="https://github.com/pbenson/qfrm-bootcamp/blob/gh-pages/python-templates/" target="_blank"><code>python-basics-notebook-empty.ipynb</code></a>. Click on the notebook, and you will see it displayed as you will see it in Jupyter. Click on the Raw button, select File->Save as..., chnage "Save as type:" to "All files" (otherwise you will end up with an unusable text file), and change the name to "python-basics-notebook.ipynb" before saving in your <code>qfrm-python</code> directory. </li>
			<li>Launch Anaconda2->Jupyter Notebook, and navigate to your <code>qfrm-python</code> directory. </li>
			<li>simple data types: int, float, boolean, string</li>
			<li>control structures: for loops, if/else</li>
			<li>collection data types: lists, dictionaries</li>
			<li>for loops with collections</li>
			<li>functions</li>
			<li>commit your work in GitHub Desktop, and sync.</li>
			<li>Go to <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> in your browser, and navigate to  <code>python-basics-notebook-empty.ipynb</code>. Copy the URL. You should see your files listed, and your README.md file has been rendered as HTML.</a>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Creatin your GitHub home page
		<ol type="a">
			<li>Go to <a href="https://pages.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>, and follow the directions to create your website hosted at yourusername.github.io. </li>
			<li>You could continue to write your own HTML. But we aren't really here to do that, and we want something simple but already designed, so we will use the GitHub Pages templates. Go to <a href-"https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub.com</a>, and go to your yourusername.github.io repository. Click on Settings, and scroll down to the Automatic Page Generator button. Click it.</li>
			<li>Class discussion ensues about what should go on this page. At a minimum, this is a good place to elaborate on your work, fleshing out what you say on your CV and LinkedIn. I recommed the following sections: Education, Skills (starting with Python), Employment. Upload files, and make good use of links. Add a screenshot of your progress on Project Euler. Perhaps tell a story about the hardest problem you've ever solved, and show some evidence of your work. </li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Additional Python practice
		<ol type="a">
			<li>From GitHub Desktop, create a GitHub repository, and name it <code>python-secret-project</code>.</li>
			<li>Create a README.md file using Atom in your <code>python-secret-project</code> directory. Add this text to it: “These are programs I’ve written to practice Python. I am striving for concise, readable, and sufficiently efficient code."</li>
			<li>Create a Jupyter notebook, and name it <code>python-secret-notebook</code>. We'll use it for problems in <a href="https://projecteuler.net/about" target="_blank">Project Euler</a>.
				<!-- <img classs="list-image" src="images/project-euler-practice.png" width="503"></img> -->
			</li>
			<li>commit your work via GitHub Desktop, and sync. Add a link to the notebook from your GitHub home page.</li>
			<li>Other practice problems you might consider...
				<ol type="a">
					<li><a href="https://code.google.com/codejam/contests.html" target="_blank">Google Code Jam</a> </li>
					<li><a href="https://programmingpraxis.com" target="_blank">Programming Praxis</a></li>

	</li>
	<li>Python applied to interview questions
		<ol type="a">
			<li>From GitHub Desktop, create a GitHub repository , and name it <code>python-interview-project</code>.</li>
			<li>Create a README.md file using Atom in your <code>python-finance-project</code> directory. Add this text to it: “These are programs I’ve written to verify solutions to interview problems.""</li>
			<li>Solve problems 1.1, 3.1, 3.5, 3.8, 3.10, 3.11, 4.4, 5.10.</li>
			<li>commit your work via GitHub Desktop, and sync.</li>

	<li>Python in Finance
		<ol type="a">
			<li>From GitHub Desktop, create a GitHub repository , and name it <code>python-finance-project</code>.</li>
			<li>Create a README.md file using Atom in your <code>python-finance-project</code> directory. Add this text to it: “These are programs I’ve written to solve quantitative finance problems. I use the <code>numpy</code> and <code>pandas</code> libraries."</li>
			<li>Create a Jupyter notebook in your project, and name it <code>zero-coupon</code>...commit.</li>
			<li>Create a notebook named <code>black-merton-scholes</code>... and commit.</li>
